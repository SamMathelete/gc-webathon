<br>AirBorneX is a web application developed for a drone delivery company to facilitate efficient and timely deliveries. This web application provides a user-friendly interface for users to request drone deliveries and track their packages in real-time. The application also provides admins with the necessary tools to manage all delivery requests efficiently and ensure timely deliveries.<br>

### <b>User Side Functionalities:</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Registration and Login:</b> Users can create an account and log in to the application using their email.</li>
  <li><b>Request a Drone:</b> Users can select the pickup and delivery points on the map and submit a request for a drone delivery.</li>
  <li><b>Real-Time Tracking:</b> Users can track their package in real-time once a drone has been dispatched. The application provides users with notifications when the drone is on its way to the pickup location and when it reaches the pickup and delivery locations.</li>
  <li><b>Package History:</b> Users can view their past delivery requests and track their status.</li>
</ul>

### <b>Admin Side Functionalities:</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Dashboard:</b> Admins can view all current delivery requests on the dashboard.</li>
  <li><b>Accept or Reject Requests:</b>  Admins can accept or reject delivery requests based on drone availability or any other constraints.</li>
  <li><b>Master Map:</b> Admins can view a master map of all active drones in service and track their location in real-time.</li>
  <li><b>Package History:</b>Admins can view past delivery requests and track their status.</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deployment
We deployed the application on Vercel, which is a cloud platform for serverless deployment. 

The easiest way to deploy a Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Conclusion
AirBorneX is a fully functional web application that provides a user-friendly interface for drone delivery requests and real-time tracking of packages. The application is built using modern web development technologies like Next.js, Material-UI, and Firebase. We hope that our application meets the requirements of the GC Webathon '23 and provides a seamless experience to the users and admins.
